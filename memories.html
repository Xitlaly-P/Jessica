                <p>She taught me the true meaning of friendship. What being a friend really is. Someone that is not only there during the good times but most importantly the hard ones. She is my go-to, my “I can tell her anything and know she’ll have my back,” she’s the one that is the happiest when I accomplish a goal and the one that’s there to cheer me up.</p>

                <p>The last memory I had of jess is when she stopped by my old job to visit me. which is cute, because it was something she did often. she would never buy anything but i would see her and she would have such a bright smile and wave at me. she would always wait until I'm done with a costumer to come over and talk to me. it was interesting to see how many topics we cover just from a 5-10 mins conversation. lol</p>

                <p>My last memory of Jessica was when she came over to get her lashes done, and the entire time we were talking about our first year experiences in college and the friends that we had made. And when she was about to leave, I told her to text me to hang out whenever she’s free, which was two weeks before.</p>

                  <p>I went to her house on June 24th 2023. We were getting ready to go get froyo in Margate. She loved that place and she knew how much I love froyo so she wanted me to try it. We sang the whole way there, ate some amazing froyo, had great conversation and sang our way back home. I’ll never forget that night because I remember she used to tell me how much she loved my hugs and that night I held her tighter than usual for some reason and now that’s a memory I will forever cherish.</p>

                  <p>Before I could even invite her to my birthday party she had already called out of work. Although it was something so small it meant to much to me. She came to my birthday party and ofcourse forgot her purse. This gave me a chance to see her the day before she passed and we talked and laughed for a while before she had to go home.</p>

              <p>The one thing that I really loved about Jess was how she was able to set things aside to help out a friend. One time I was going through a hard time and felt very alone. Then I called Jessica out of nowhere at night and asked if she wanted to talk. I picked her up and she came out with her blanket and pajamas. We drove to McDonalds and she showed me that you can get both M&Ms as well as oreos in a McFlurry. We then drove down this road just talking. It was such a fun time I had with her and she listened to me and helped me out so much.</p>

              <p>One of my favorite memories is this time where we just got done one of her quince practices and i was the last one left to get picked up. we sat down on her couch just chilling and scrolling through our instagram and snapchat and she came across this photoshop picture of Shrek. When i tell you it caught me off guard, IT CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD and we bursted out laughing and tbh i don't even think it was that funny, but i think it was because were SO tired that we found it 10x funny that day. the picture also had a phrase that we would say here and there and it would bring us back to that moment/memory. To this day i still have the picture of shrek on my favorites album on my phone.</p>

                <p>Jessica was someone who I felt like we hit milestones together. One of the biggest one was graduating highschool and we both wanted to celebrate it together. That experience meant so much to me and it was fun planning the party and talking about how far we have come. I could think of no better person to celebrate with.</p>

              <p>Thinking back now, its more what wasn't unique about her. she was smart, gorgeous, athletic, a good daughter, an amazing friend and she was beyond caring. she was generous and mad funny. her random thoughts would make you question her sometimes but in such a funny/good way. she was someone who love doing things which meant planning hang outs with family and friends and getting dressed up for them. Another amazing quality she would do, is put others before her. she was the definition of the perfect girl.</p>
