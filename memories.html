                <p>The one thing that I really loved about Jess was how she was able to set things aside to help out a friend. One time I was going through a hard time and felt very alone. Then I called Jessica out of nowhere at night and asked if she wanted to talk. I picked her up and she came out with her blanket and pajamas. We drove to McDonalds and she showed me that you can get both M&Ms as well as oreos in a McFlurry. We then drove down this road just talking. It was such a fun time I had with her and she listened to me and helped me out so much.</p>
